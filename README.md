# ATTENDANCE REPORT (A MORINGA PROJECT)

## “The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot.” – Michael Althsuler

### Businessmen like to say that “time is money” but it is much more than that. Time is our greatest asset, but it is what we choose to do with the time that we have available to us, that will define who we are and what you achieve in life. Time is one of the few things in life that you cannot get back.
